# The purpose of this project is to run a command-line application using Node.js to automatically generate a README.md file to use in Github. Once invoked, the application will ask the user a series of questions; the user's responses will be used to fill out the required parts of the README. After all questions have been answered, the README.md will be dynamically generated in the file location that the application is ran in.
